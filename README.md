### Lighthearted Physics-Based Survival Game

Do you want to take control of a crash test dummy and run around as your plastic peers scream and get thrown around? Then this is the game (and the full, open-source Unity 2019.2 project) for you!

### Featuring: 
  - Ragdolls!
  - Explosions!
  - A minimalist, Katamari Damacy-esque aesthetics!
  - Simple round based system that entreprising developers can modify as they please.
  - Clean third person controls.

This was crafted on the couch in a couple of hours after I realized that I wanted a little more excercise with Unity's physics system and Scriptable Objects - while it's a good place to start if you want to mess with a physics-based sample project, it's not *that* clean or well optimized.
